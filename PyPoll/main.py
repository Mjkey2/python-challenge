#PyPoll instructions!!

#derive data set from election_data.csv

#create these three variables
    #voter ID
    #county
    #candidate

#create a script that analyzes and calculates the following:
    #The total number of votes cast

    #A complete list of candidates who received votes

    #The percentage of votes each candidate won

    #The total number of votes each candidate won

    #The winner of the election based on popular vote

#Analysis should align with the following results
    #Election Results
    
    #Total Votes: 369711
  
    #Charles Casper Stockham: 23.049% (85213)
    #Diana DeGette: 73.812% (272892)
    #Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.139% (11606)

    #Winner: Diana DeGette

#the final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a TEXT FILE with the results
